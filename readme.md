# goals

Literally every software project out there that defines goals in the readme just spits some marketing buzz words.
Aiming for fast, reliable, modular, readable and scalable code. If you want that use literally any other code base :D

The focus of this code base is being messy. Making things worse then they already were. Introduce complexity where none is needed.
